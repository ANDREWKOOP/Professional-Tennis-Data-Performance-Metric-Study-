--- Quantifying Return Adaptability in Professional Tennis ---
This repository contains the code and data processing pipeline for a capstone project introducing RAAVBSS (Return Accuracy Across Varying Body Serve Speeds), a new metric for measuring how well professional tennis players return body serves across different speed zones (slow, medium, fast).

The project uses unsupervised learning (K-Means clustering) to identify returner archetypes and validates these clusters with match outcome data. Visualizations include radar charts, bar plots, PCA scatterplots, and violin-boxplots to help interpret the return profiles.

Key Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, seaborn, matplotlib
Data Source: Jeff Sackmann Tennis Repository (Grand Slam point-level and match-level data, 2010â€“2024)
